# AI Shell Agent

**AI Shell Agent** is a command-line LLM-powered tool that can help you perform tasks by writing and executing terminal commands (with human confirmation or edit) and responding to questions, directly from the console.  
It features a very simple CLI and adjusts the LLM prompts based on your detected system.  
Works on Windows, Linux with Bash, and Mac. (Tested on Windows, please contribute!)

### Installation

```bash
pip install ai-shell-agent
```
This will automatically install the CLI tool in your current Python environment.  
Requires `python=3.11.x`.  
You can also clone and install from the repository.

Please make sure your python scripts are added to path correctly. 

### Quick Examples

#### Send a message to AI
```bash
ai "your message here"
```
The AI will respond and may suggest commands that can help with your request.

#### Execute command yourself and add to context
```bash
ai -x "dir"
ai "tell me about these files"
```
This will execute the command and add the output to the AI logs, then you can ask about it.

#### Create a new chat for a different task
```bash
ai -c "Project Deployment"
ai "help me deploy my Flask app to Heroku"
```
This creates a dedicated chat for your task, keeping the conversation focused.

#### Start a temporary chat
```bash
ai -tc "how do I check disk space in Windows?"
```
Creates a quick chat session for one-off questions.

#### Edit your last message
```bash
ai -e "updated question with more details"
```
Lets you refine your last message if you forgot important details.

### First-Time Setup

When you first use AI Shell Agent, you'll be prompted to:

1. **Select an AI Model**:
   ```
   Available models:
   OpenAI:
   - gpt-4o-mini (aliases: 4o-mini) <- Current Model
   - gpt-4o (aliases: 4o)
   - o3-mini
   Google:
   - gemini-1.5-pro
   - gemini-2.5-pro
   
   Please input the model you want to use, or leave empty to keep using the current model gpt-4o-mini.
   > 
   ```

2. **Enter the appropriate API key**:
   After selecting a model, you'll be prompted for the corresponding API key (OpenAI or Google).
   The key will be saved to a local `.env` file for future sessions.

You can later change your model or API key using:
```bash
ai --select-model  # Interactive model selection
ai --model "gpt-4o"  # Directly set model
ai -k  # Update your API key
```

### Main Features

- **AI Writes and Executes Commands**: The AI will suggest commands to accomplish your tasks, which you can review, edit, or approve.
  
- **Multiple AI Model Support**: Choose between OpenAI models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, o3-mini) and Google AI models (gemini-1.5-pro, gemini-2.5-pro).
  
- **System Detection**: Automatically detects your OS and tailors commands to work with Windows CMD, Linux bash, or macOS Terminal.
  
- **Chat Management System**: Create, rename, list, and delete chat sessions to organize different tasks or projects.
  
- **Python Code Execution**: Run and evaluate Python code snippets (experimental feature).

- **AI-Powered Code Editing**: Make natural language code changes to your files using the integrated code editing capabilities. Add files to the session and describe the changes you want to make.

- **Modular Toolsets**: Use specialized tools like the terminal executor or code editor that can be enabled/disabled per chat session.

## Quickstart Guide

### Selecting a Model

On first run, AI Shell Agent will prompt you to select your preferred model:

```
Available models:
OpenAI:
- gpt-4o-mini (aliases: 4o-mini) <- Current Model
- gpt-4o (aliases: 4o)
- o3-mini
Google:
- gemini-1.5-pro
- gemini-2.5-pro

Please input the model you want to use, or leave empty to keep using the current model gpt-4o-mini.
> 
```

You can also change the model at any time:

```bash
ai --model "gpt-4o"  # or any supported model name/alias
```

### Setting Up the API Key

After selecting a model, the application will prompt you for the appropriate API key:

```bash
$ ai "Hi"
No OpenAI API key found. Please enter your API key.
You can get it from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
Enter OpenAI API key:
```

After entering the key, it will be saved in a `.env` file located in the project's installation directory. This ensures that your API key is securely stored and automatically loaded in future sessions.

### Managing the API Key

If you need to update or set a new API key at any time, use the following command:

```bash
ai -k
```

Shorthand:  
```bash
ai -k
```

### Starting a Chat Session

Create a new chat session with a title:

```bash
ai -c "My Chat Session"
```

Shorthand:  
```bash
ai -c "My Chat Session"
```

### Sending a Message

To send a message to the active chat session:

```bash
ai "what is the time right now?"
```

### Executing Shell Commands

Run a shell command directly:

```bash
ai -x "dir"
```

Shorthand:  
```bash
ai -x "dir"
```

By automatically detecting your operating system (via Python's `platform` library), AI Shell Agent customizes its console suggestions for Windows CMD, Linux bash, or macOS Terminal.

## Toolsets

AI Shell Agent uses a modular architecture with specialized toolsets that extend its capabilities:

### Available Toolsets

1. **Terminal**: Execute shell commands with proper handling for different operating systems.
   - Becomes active when you ask the AI to run a command
   - Handles Windows CMD, PowerShell, Linux Bash, and macOS terminal commands

2. **File Editor**: Edit code files with natural language instructions, powered by Aider.
   - Becomes active when you ask to edit code or start a code editing session
   - Supports many programming languages
   - AI will analyze, explain, and modify your code

### Toolset States

Each toolset can be in one of these states for a chat session:

- **Enabled**: The toolset is available for the AI to use
- **Active**: The toolset is currently in use
- **Disabled**: The toolset is not available for the current chat

You can manage toolsets with these commands:
```bash
ai --select-tools           # Choose which toolsets to enable
ai --list-toolsets          # See all toolsets and their current status
ai --configure-toolset NAME # Run configuration for a specific toolset
```

            â”œâ”€â”€ aider.json
            â””â”€â”€ terminal.json
```

### Creating a New Toolset

To create a new toolset:

1. Create a directory structure under `ai_shell_agent/toolsets/your_toolset_name/`
2. Create these files:
   - `__init__.py`: Package initializer
   - `toolset.py`: Tool implementations and registration
   - `prompts.py`: Any toolset-specific prompts

3. In `toolset.py`, define a registration function like:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import BaseTool
from ...toolsets.toolsets import register_toolset, ToolsetMetadata

def register_your_toolset():
    # 1. Create your tool classes derived from BaseTool
    class YourTool(BaseTool):
        name = "your_tool_name"
        description = "Description of what your tool does"
        
        def _run(self, query: str):
            # Tool implementation
            return "Result"
    
    # 2. Define a configuration function (optional)
    def configure_your_toolset(config_path, current_config):
        # Interactive configuration logic here
        # Save configuration to config_path
        pass
    
    # 3. Register the toolset
    tools = [YourTool()]
    starter_tool = YourTool() # Or another class for activation
    
    metadata = ToolsetMetadata(
        id="your_toolset_id",
        name="Your Toolset",
        description="What your toolset does",
        tools=tools,
        start_tool=starter_tool,
        configure_func=configure_your_toolset,
        config_defaults={"key1": "default1"}
    )
    
    register_toolset(metadata)
```

4. Import and call your registration function in `ai_shell_agent/toolsets/toolsets.py`.
